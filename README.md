 Custom Twitch Chat Overlay with Pronoun Badges

## How to use
`{{ channel }}` in `index.html` should be changed to the Twitch channel chat you want to connect to.

Emoji images (not the sheet) of your choice should be downloaded from https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data and placed in `/static/emoji/` in order to function.
